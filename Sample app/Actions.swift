 Used to specify the type of command being issued to the various Logic modules, via LogicController.sharedInstance.performAction(...).

 Any expensive action logic should be performed asynchronously (on a background thread).
 A separate action for the results would be performed, and in turn mutate the appState itself on the main thread.

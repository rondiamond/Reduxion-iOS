# Reduxion-iOS


### TL;DR
Easy-to-implement, best-practice Unidirectional Data Flow for iOSÂ apps, featuring:  
- Loosely-coupled layers for View / Business Logic / Services / Data
- Composable business logic, in single-responsibility units
- Good separation of concerns facilitating automated testing (TDD/BDD)
- Ability to switch entire application from real to mock services using one line of code
- Ability to easily persist & recall the entire state of the application
- Ability to easily add time travel (rewind/fast-forward) between different states of the application

### Conceptual Overview

Reduxion-iOS is a Clean Architecture implementation, based on the patterns of:
- [Unidirectional data flow](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=unidirectional%20data%20flow)
- [Redux's unified "state container" data model](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=redux%20%22state%20container%22)

It is a custom implementation, inspired in part by [Redux-iOS](https://github.com/armin/Redux-iOS) by Armin Kroll.

Article on how *Reduxion-iOS* came about, and the problems it's intended to solve:  
[**Introducing "Reduxion iOS"**](https://medium.com/p/6e1cdf5d7570/)  (Medium.com)

### TL;DR
Easy-to-implement Unidirectional Data Flow for iOS apps, with added features:  
- Loosely-coupled layers for View / Business Logic / Services / Data
- Composable business logic, in single-responsibility units
- Designed for unit testability (TDD/BDD)
- Ability to switch entire application from real to mock services using one line of code
- Ability to easily persist & recall the entire state of the application

*[blah blah blah]*


intended to be a best-practice

### Essential Architectural Overview  
A few resources essential to understanding the underlying design patterns:

[***The Principles of Clean Architecture***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_TH-Y78tt4&t=10m45s) - Robert Martin  
Superb overview of clean architectural design principles [1 hour].  Highly recommended.

[***Unidirectional Data Flow: Shrinking Massive View Controllers***](https://realm.io/news/benji-encz-unidirectional-data-flow-swift/) - Benjamin Encz  
Video explaining the unidirectional data flow design pattern and its advantages in depth [31+ minutes].

[***Redux for iOS***](http://blog.jtribe.com.au/redux-for-ios/) - Armin Kroll  
Good, concise overview (of one available library which has been modified for use in this project).
